# Shopworker CLI Overview

The Shopworker CLI is a Node.js tool for working with Shopify orders using API version 2025-04.

## Main Components

- [cli.js](mdc:cli.js) - Main entry point and command definitions
- `jobs/` - Contains job implementations
- `triggers/` - Contains webhook trigger definitions
- `graphql/` - Contains GraphQL queries and mutations
- `utils/` - Contains utility functions

## Workflow

1. The CLI detects which job to run from the directory or command arguments
2. It loads the job configuration from the job's directory
3. It uses the trigger defined in the job config to determine which GraphQL query to execute
4. It fetches data from Shopify and passes it to the job's processing function
5. The job processes the data (e.g., tagging orders with SKUs)
