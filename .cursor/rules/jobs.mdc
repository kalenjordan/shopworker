# Jobs Structure

Jobs are the core processing units of the Shopworker CLI. Each job is contained in its own directory under the `jobs/` folder.

## Job Directory Structure

A job directory contains:
- [config.json](mdc:jobs/order-created-tag-skus/config.json) - Configuration file specifying the trigger to use
- [job.js](mdc:jobs/order-created-tag-skus/job.js) - The implementation of the job's processing logic

## Example Job

The `order-created-tag-skus` job:
- Is triggered when a new order is created
- Extracts SKUs from line items in the order
- Adds these SKUs as tags to the order
- Uses [OrderUpdate.graphql](mdc:graphql/OrderUpdate.graphql) to update the order via Shopify's API

## Creating New Jobs

To create a new job:
1. Create a new directory under `jobs/`
2. Add a `config.json` file to specify the trigger
3. Implement the job's logic in `job.js` with an exported `process` function
4. The `process` function will receive the Shopify data object and the Shopify API client
