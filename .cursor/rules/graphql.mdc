# GraphQL Structure

The Shopworker CLI uses GraphQL to interact with the Shopify API. All GraphQL queries and mutations are stored in the `graphql/` directory.

## File Naming Convention

GraphQL queries and mutations are stored as JavaScript files that export the query string:
- [GetRecentOrders.js](mdc:graphql/GetRecentOrders.js) - Query to fetch recent orders
- [GetOrderById.js](mdc:graphql/GetOrderById.js) - Query to fetch a specific order by ID
- [OrderUpdate.js](mdc:graphql/OrderUpdate.js) - Mutation to update an order

Each file exports the GraphQL operation as a tagged template literal:

```javascript
export default `#graphql
query GetRecentOrders($first: Int!, $query: String) {
  // query fields...
}
`;
```

## Usage Pattern

GraphQL queries are imported directly where needed:

```javascript
import GetRecentOrders from '../../graphql/GetRecentOrders.js';

// Use the query directly with the GraphQL client
const response = await shopify.graphql(GetRecentOrders, variables);
```

## Trigger Integration

Queries for testing are specified in trigger configurations which reference the GraphQL file to use (without extension).
